# PyCalculator
A simple graphical calculator written in Python using Tkinter that has been loosely modeled after
the "Standard" Calculator found on the Windows operating system. It allows for calculating 
two operators and one operand and returning a result.
It is missing several operands and requires input via the buttons in the GUI. 
Validating keyboard input into the entry element would be a good next step as would be adding
multi-operand and the use of parenthesis and exponents.
